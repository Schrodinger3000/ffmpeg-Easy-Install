Ubuntu & Fedora EASY ffmpeg-4 install
====

As easy as it sound:

1. Load shell script in a directory
2. Chmod 755 <script of your choice>.sh
3. Launch the script from terminal ./<script of your choice>.sh

NB. Only for the RPM install in Fedora you have the choice to install it or not (in the case it's already installed only).

Enjoy!
